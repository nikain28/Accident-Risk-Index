# Accident-Risk-Index

The Accident Risk Index is a Data Warehouse Project designed to apply our knowledge in handling big data warehouse tools. Focused on the road traffic accident dataset in the United Kingdom continent, this project aims to achieve specific objectives:

1. To observe the state that has the highest accident rate.
2. To identify factors that affect the accident rate.
3. To observe the effectiveness of police authority on roads.

Employing ETL pipeline, data extraction, transformation, and loading processed are executed seamlessly.

Specifically, we utilized PostgreSQL to extract data from CSV files, conducted transformations via Python integrated with Jupyter Notebook, and reloaded the cleaned data into PostgreSQL.

Leveraging PostgreSQL as the data warehouse tool, this project involves data handling and storage, employing operations such as dicing, slicing, joined tables, and roll-up for in-depth analysis. Furthermore, the insights derived are visualized using Microsoft Power BI, showcasing analyses through bar graphs, pie charts, donut charts, line graphs, and a comprehensive dashboard summarizing the dataset on a single page.
